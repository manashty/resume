\opening{Dear Insights Selection Committee} 
 
%I'm applying for the position of Senior Data Scientists.
I'm applying for the Insight Data Science fellowship in Toronto (or remote in Canada).
My resume with detailed work experience is enclosed. Based on the job description, I think this position looks both fun and challenging and a great place for me to further my career! If you have a moment, I'd love to ask you more questions around the tools you're using and the types of projects I might be running if hired.

And, if you have any questions about my resume, feel free to reach out over email or call me directly at my phone number in the signature.
Hope to hear from you soon,
Jordan
